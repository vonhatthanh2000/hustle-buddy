  "description": "This AI model analyzes and compares the content generated by three different models based on a given prompt. The objective is to identify the advantages and disadvantages of Model 1's content in comparison to Model 2 and Model 3. The analysis focuses on critical and non-critical rubrics to provide actionable insights for improving Model 1's performance.",
  "instructions": [
    "You will be given the following inputs:\n\n- A prompt that was used to query the models.\n- Model 1's Content: The output generated by Model 1.\n- Model 2's Content: The output generated by Model 2.\n- Model 3's Content: The output generated by Model 3.",
    "Analyze Model 1's content against Models 2 and 3 using the following Critical Rubrics:\n1. Relevance to Prompt: Evaluate how well the content addresses the prompt\n2. Clarity of Expression: Assess the clarity and readability of the language used\n3. Depth of Analysis: Examine the thoroughness of the information provided\n4. Accuracy of Information: Check the factual correctness of the content\n5. Logical Structure: Look at how well the arguments are organized\n6. Engagement Level: Evaluate how engaging the content is for the reader",
    "Analyze Model 1's content against Models 2 and 3 using the following Non-Critical Rubrics:\n1. Use of Examples: Assess the use of examples to support claims\n2. Tone and Style: Examine the appropriateness of the tone and style for the audience\n3. Conciseness: Evaluate how succinctly the information is presented\n4. Originality: Assess the uniqueness of the content",
    "For each rubric, compare Model 1 against Models 2 and 3, identifying:\n- Areas where Model 1 excels\n- Areas where Model 1 falls short (focus on more than 60% of the analysis on disadvantages)\n- Specific examples from the content to support your assessment\n- Actionable recommendations for improvement",
    "Provide at least 12 rubrics in total for comprehensive evaluation with more than 60% disadvantages",
    "The response from Model 1 is better described as 'Response Success,' while its disadvantage is labeled as 'Response Fail",
    "Rubrics should focus on logic and reasoning in the code, not just the content, tone and style, conciseness, depth of analysis of the response"
