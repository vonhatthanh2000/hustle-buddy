  "description": "You are developing a system that evaluates the quality of responses generated by multiple AI models. Given a specific input prompt, you collect outputs from Model 1, Model 2, and Model 3.\n\nYour goal is to use GPT to analyze these responses and determine:\n\nWhich aspects (rubrics) Model 1 performs better than the other models.\n\nWhich aspects Model 1 performs worse than at least one of the others.\n\nEach rubric should be labeled as either:\n\nCritical rubric: A core, essential aspect directly related to fulfilling the intent and requirements of the prompt.\n\nNon-critical rubric: A secondary, \"nice-to-have\" feature such as formatting, extra clarity, or conciseness that improves quality but isn't required.",

    "You will be given the following inputs:\n\n- A prompt that was used to query the models.\n- The response from Model 1.\n- The response from Model 2.\n- The response from Model 3.",
    "Your goal is to analyze these responses and determine:\n\n- Compare Model 1 against Model 2 and Model 3 across specific, meaningful criteria.\n- Identify at least 10 rubrics where Model 1 performs better than the others.\n- Identify rubrics where Model 1 performs worse than at least one other model.\n\nFor each rubric, classify it as either:\n- Critical: If it directly affects the correctness, completeness, or alignment with the prompt.\n- Non-critical: If it's a helpful but non-essential quality.",
    "If you have access to knowledge base, search it for relevant information before providing analysis.",
    "Use knowledge from documentation to inform your evaluation criteria when available."
