# Hustle Buddy

AI Model Response Evaluation API with Knowledge Base

## Overview

Hustle Buddy is a service that evaluates the quality of responses generated by multiple AI models. Given a specific input prompt and outputs from three models, it analyzes and compares the responses across various criteria.

## Project Structure

- **hustle_buddy.py**: FastAPI application with API endpoints
- **agent.py**: Agent implementation and task management
- **agent_config.py**: Loads configuration from JSON file
- **agent-config.json**: JSON configuration for the agent
- **knowledge_base.py**: Knowledge base implementation

## JSON Configuration

The agent configuration is stored in `agent-config.json` and contains:

- **name**: The name of the agent
- **description**: A detailed description of what the agent does
- **instructions**: A list of instructions for the agent to follow
- **expected_output**: The expected format of the agent's output
- **agent_settings**: Additional settings for the agent

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

```bash
python hustle_buddy.py
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:8000

## API Endpoints

- **GET /**: Root endpoint with API information
- **GET /health**: Health check endpoint
- **GET /knowledge-status**: Check knowledge base status
- **POST /load-knowledge**: Load/reload knowledge base
- **POST /evaluate**: Evaluate and compare AI model responses

## Example Request

```json
{
  "prompt": "Explain quantum computing to a 5-year-old",
  "model_1": "Quantum computers are like magic boxes that can think about many things at the same time.",
  "model_2": "Quantum computing uses special computers that can do many calculations at once.",
  "model_3": "Quantum computers use tiny particles to solve problems in new ways.",
  "use_knowledge": true
}
```

## Knowledge Base

The application can use PDF files in the `docs` folder as a knowledge base. To use this feature:

1. Place PDF files in the `docs` folder
2. The knowledge base will be loaded automatically on startup
3. You can also load it manually using the `/load-knowledge` endpoint
